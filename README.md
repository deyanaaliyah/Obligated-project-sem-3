### A functional CRUD Album website designed with Bootstrap

1. CRUD
<br /> It is possible to create and delete albums from database <br />
2. Uses JPA in Spring project
<br /> For easier and faster demo versions of application <br />
3. Written in half a day (+/-)
<br /> This is a school project for my third semester at KEA <br />
4. Foreign keys <br />
<br /> The Album table has both artist's name and album's genre working as a foreign key. In the [data.sql](https://github.com/deyanaaliyah/Obligated-project-sem-3/blob/main/src/main/resources/data.sql "directory") file, you'll see that the parameters: ```MySQL artist_name``` and ```MySQL genre_category``` has values of numbers, but when visualised on localhost:8080 it shows us the actual artist and the album's genre instead of these numbers.
